# Vagrant Harddisk Plugin

This vagrant plugin creates and formats additional hard disks to use inside the machine.

Warning: At the moment this plugin just works with Parallels, and therefore with OS X.

## Installation

```
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-harddisk
```

## Configuration

 TODO: ?????

## Development

TODO: Replace default text.

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
